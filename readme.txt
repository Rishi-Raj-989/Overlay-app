Architecture
    models/: Contains the classes or modules responsible for handling data and business logic.
    views/: Includes the files for the UI design and layout.
    controllers/: Contains the controllers that handle user interactions and manage the flow of data between the model and the view.
    utils/: Includes utility functions or helper modules that can be used across different components.
    resources/: Contains any external resources, such as images or configuration files, used by the application.
    main.py: The entry point of the application that initializes the necessary components and starts the application.


Design-:

    User Interface (UI) Design: Keep the UI clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. Use appropriate fonts, colors, and visual elements to enhance the user experience. Ensure that the UI elements are responsive and accessible.

    Floating Window: Design a floating window that remains on top of other applications. The window should be draggable, resizable, and have controls to minimize or close it. Consider providing transparency options to make it less obtrusive.

    Text Copying: Include a designated area or button to capture and store the text from the active application. You can display the captured text in the UI for the user to access or manipulate.

    Chatbot Interface: Design an area or chat window where users can input queries and receive responses from the chatbot. Consider using a conversational UI design that provides a natural and interactive experience.

    Permission Requests: Design clear and concise permission request dialogs or prompts to inform the user about the required permissions and their purpose. Make sure to adhere to platform-specific design guidelines for permission requests.


Notes
    To develop a standalone desktop application using Python, you can explore libraries such as PyQt, PySide, or Tkinter, which provide GUI frameworks for building desktop applications. These frameworks allow you to create windows, design the user interface, and handle user interactions effectively.
